## One hamming distance

https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/1604069/Google-Interview-or-1st-round-or

There are n String with equal m length. Find if any two string have 1 hamming distance.
return only true or false;

input -> ["abcd","bbcd","xyzs"]
output -> true

n <=10^6

m <=1000

Hint -> remove one chars from every string and check

In information theory, the Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different.
